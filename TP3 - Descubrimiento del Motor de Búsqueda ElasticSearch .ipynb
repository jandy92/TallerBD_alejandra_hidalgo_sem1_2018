    "    'abstract':'Strengthening critical thinking abilities of citizens in the face of news published on the web represents a key challenge for education. Young citizens appear to be vulnerable in the face of poor quality news or those containing non-explicit ideologies. In the field of data science, computational and statistical techniques have been developed to automatically collect and characterize online news media in real time. Nevertheless, there is still not a lot of interdisciplinary research on how to design data exploration platforms supporting an educational process of critical citizenship. This article explores this opportunity through a case study analyzing critical thinking ability of students when facing news dealing with the social mobilization \"No+APF\". From data collected through 4 online exercises conducted by 75 secondary school students. 55 university students and 25 communication specialists, we investigate to what extent young citizens are able to classify news headiness and ideological orientation of news media outlets. We also question the influence of the media is brand name and the subjectivity of each participant in regards to the social mobilization \"No+APF\". The results underline the importance of group work, the influence of the brand name and the correlation between critical-thinking abilities and having a defined opinion.' ,\n",

Single-blind randomised clinical trial. Forty edentulous patients were randomly divided into 2 groups. One group received dentures made using the conventional method (CG), and the other using a simplified technique (SG) that omits the use of functional impressions (with modelling compound and ZOE impression paste) and an articulator to assemble the models. Overall patient satisfaction was assessed at 3 and 6months by means of a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). The comparisons were made using a repeated measures ANOVA (P=.05). No significant differences were found in terms of the satisfaction stated by the patients or the quality of the prosthesis evaluated by a professional among the dentures made using the traditional (n=17) and simplified (n=21) techniques.

In order to do this, twenty four university careers corresponding to two Chilean Universities were evaluated: Universidad Austral de Chile (UACh) and the Universidad de Santiago de Chile (USACh). A total sample of 1.334 students was used for the study. This article focuses its attention on the four UACh is Medicine Careers, using a sample of 225 students. In a comparative analysis of the twenty four careers analyzed as a whole, the UACh is Medicine Faculty achieved the highest grades according to the evaluation made by the students of their respective curricular system. The measuring instrument contains a test battery for cognitive evaluations and curricular stress. This partial result coincides with the total result of the sample. In this way, the inverse relationship between the high level of academic demands and the corresponding low level of stress, and vice-versa, is confirmed. The UACh is Medicine Faculty careers show high demand levels with moderately high stress levels. In particular, the evaluations of personal situations reflect a high self esteem, accompanied with moderately low stress levels. In relation to the ideal idea of what is supposed to be a good curricular system, the students expect high demand levels, showing moderate stressor consequences. These expectations are similar to the rest of the evaluated careers of both universities. ' ,\n",

    "    'abstract':'The estimation of the forest and vegetation cover in the Valdivian Rainforest Eco-region (35º - 43º30´ S) of Chile in the Pre-European period emerges as a relevant scientific question due to its implications for forest conservation and for the improvement of the understanding of the patterns and dynamics of human settlement. This study uses a transdisciplinary approach integrating information from historical documents, archaeological evidence and the relationship of present vegetation with environmental variables. From this analysis we developed the first reconstruction of the forest and vegetation in the Valdivian Rainforest Eco-region circa 1550 (1:500.000 scale map). Our results indicate that native forests covered 11.3 million ha ca. 1550 at the Spanish conqueror arrival, decreasing to 5.7 million ha in 2007 (50.4 % of the original area). This reduction is due to the conversion of native forests to pasturelands, shrublands and agriculture land and, since 1974, forest plantations of exotic species. This study shows the need to continue developing transdisciplinary research, which integrates historical, archaeological and biophysical (potential vegetation, pollen analysis and dendrochronology) data to improve the understanding of changing forest and vegetation cover under climatic fluctuations and human influences during the last 450 years.' ,\n",
